Assignment 2 for SMU guildhall graduate application

Process:
	Create nodes for the creation of a binary tree first
	Create Bitwise IO manager
	Test Bitwise IO manager operations
		Slightly automate testing with makefile commands
	Started making trees
	made compression PQ
	made

Testing:
	Empty file
	Small text sample from a random wikipedia article
	Random files generated by the Linux command `dd if=/dev/zero of=file.txt count=1024 bs=1024`
		Sizes 1MB, 10 MB, 100MB, 1GB
	Differences between beginning and ending files were tested using Linux command `diff`
	Valgrind showed non non reachable memory on exit
	Time to compress larger files was troublesome after all of this.
	I increased buffer size and allowed a shortcut for reading in whole bytes in the IO manager but it does not appear to have sped up
