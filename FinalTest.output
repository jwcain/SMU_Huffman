The meiotic recombination checkpoint monitors the meiotic recombination during meiosis, and blocks the entry into metaphase I if the recombination is not efficiently processed. Meiotic recombination contributes to the cells in three different ways. First, to achieve proper segregation, each pair of homologous chromosomes must be linked to each other to maintain a certain level of tension between them. Such tension is supposed to help the assembly of spindles and generally depends on meiotic recombination. Secondly, meiotic recombination increases the genetic diversity of gametes, making them readily adapt to new environment. Thirdly, meiotic recombination is a DNA repair process that removes damages from the DNA passed on to gametes.
